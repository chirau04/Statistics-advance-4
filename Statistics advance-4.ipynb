    "The main difference between a T-test and a Z-test lies in the population standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. T-test: It's used when the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample. A T-test is typically used when the sample size is small (less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown. For example, if you want to compare the mean heights of two groups of students, one group from School A and the other from School B, you might use a T-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Z-test: It's used when the population standard deviation is known. A Z-test is appropriate when the sample size is large (usually n > 30) and the population standard deviation is known. For instance, if you want to determine if the mean score of a standardized test for a certain group of students is significantly different from the national average, and you have access to the population standard deviation, you would use a Z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, T-tests are used when the population standard deviation is unknown or when dealing with small sample sizes, while Z-tests are appropriate when the population standard deviation is known and when working with larger sample sizes."

    "The difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test lies in the directionality of the hypothesis being tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-tailed test: In a one-tailed test, the hypothesis being tested is directional, meaning it specifies either an increase or a decrease in the parameter being tested. The critical region, where the null hypothesis would be rejected, is located entirely on one side of the sampling distribution. One-tailed tests are used when there is a specific directional hypothesis or when it is only meaningful to test for an effect in one direction. For example, testing whether a new drug increases blood pressure would be a one-tailed test if the hypothesis is that the drug increases blood pressure, but there is no interest in whether it decreases blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two-tailed test: In a two-tailed test, the hypothesis being tested is non-directional, meaning it does not specify whether the parameter being tested will increase or decrease. The critical region is split between both sides of the sampling distribution. Two-tailed tests are used when the researcher wants to determine if there is a difference between groups, but does not have a specific directional hypothesis. For example, testing whether a coin is fair (i.e., has an equal chance of landing heads or tails) would be a two-tailed test because there is interest in whether the coin is biased towards either outcome.\n",

    "In hypothesis testing, Type I and Type II errors represent the two kinds of mistakes that can occur when making a decision about whether to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type I error (False Positive): This occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected when it is actually true. In other words, it's the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis. The probability of committing a Type I error is denoted by the significance level, often denoted by α (alpha). It represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",

A Type I error would occur if the test incorrectly indicates that a healthy individual has the disease, leading to unnecessary treatments and anxiety for the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Type II error (False Negative): This occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. In other words, it's the failure to reject a false null hypothesis.
